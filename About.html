    <p class="first">I am a passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation
         in programming languages such as C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
         I enjoy creating user-friendly and responsive web pages while 
         continuously improving my coding skills. My goal is to build modern, efficient,
         and visually appealing websites that provide a great user experience.</p>

                <h2>My Hobby — Reading Books</h2>
                <p> One of my favorite hobbies is reading books. I love exploring different genres like 
        self-improvement, fiction, and programming. Books open up new perspectives and 
        help me learn from the experiences of others. Reading keeps my mind active, 
        improves my vocabulary, and inspires me to think creatively. 
        It’s not just a hobby for me — it’s a way to relax and grow every single day.</p>

            <h2>Making Websites</h2>
            <p>Creating websites is one of my favorite hobbies.
                 I love turning ideas into interactive 
                 and visually appealing designs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                 Every new project gives me a chance to learn something exciting 
                 from animations to responsive layouts. Making websites helps me express 
                 my creativity while improving my problem-solving skills. 
                 It feels amazing to see a blank screen transform into
                 a real website that others can visit and enjoy.
                  For me, web development is not just coding 
                 it’s an art of creating digital experiences.</p>
